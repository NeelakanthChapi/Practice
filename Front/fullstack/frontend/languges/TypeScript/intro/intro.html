    <h1>TypeScript</h1>
    <p>TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.</p>
    <p>This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.</p>
    <h2>Why should I use TypeScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.</p>
