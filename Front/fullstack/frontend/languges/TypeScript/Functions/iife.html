<h1>IIfe</h1>
<p>It is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it defined. An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) <br>can be used for avoiding the variable hoisting from within the blocks. It allows the public access to methods <br>while retaining the privacy for variables defined in the function.</p>





<script>
    console.log(1234)
    function abc(){
        console.log(12345)
    }
   // abc()
    (()=>{
        console.log(12345)
    })()
