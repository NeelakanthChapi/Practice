<h1>IIfe</h1>
<p>It is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it defined. An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) <br>can be used for avoiding the variable hoisting from within the blocks. It allows the public access to methods <br>while retaining the privacy for variables defined in the function.</p>
<p>IIFE is a design pattern that is also known as the Self-Executing Anonymous Function. It contains two major parts:</p>
<p>1.The first part is the anonymous function having a lexical scope, which is enclosed within the Grouping operator ().</p>
<p>2.The second part creates the IIFE by which the JavaScript engine will interpret the function directly.</p>

        console.log(12345)
    })()
