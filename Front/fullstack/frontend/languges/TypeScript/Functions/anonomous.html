<h1>Anonymous</h1>
<p>TypeScript Anonymous Functions are functions that are not bound to an identifier i.e., anonymous functions do not have name of the function.</p>
<p>Anonymous functions are used as inline functions. These are used when the function is used only once and does not require a name. <br>The best example is a callback function.</p>




<script>
   let myfun= function (){
return "hello"
    }
    console.log(myfun())
</script>
